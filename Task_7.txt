Task 7

Create a comprehensive sentiment analysis dashboard for your home study text:
	1. Use the NRC dictionary to analyze the emotional composition of your home text
	2. Create a three-panel visualization showing:
   		(a) The proportion of different emotions
   		(b) The positive/negative balance
   		(c) The cumulative emotional trajectory with key narrative points highlighted
	3. Be prepared to discuss how emotional patterns align with key narrative moments in your text

 [1] "This was the forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst."                     
 [2] "This roused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground."                                       
 [3] "I slaked my thirst at the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep."                                                                                         
 [4] "\"It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half frightened, as it were, instinctively, finding myself so desolate."                                            
 [5] "Before I had quitted your apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some clothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night."
 [6] "I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could distinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat down and wept."                      
 [7] "\"Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of pleasure."                                                                                    
 [8] "I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees."                                                                                                    
 [9] "[The moon] I gazed with a kind of wonder."                                                                                                                            
[10] "It moved slowly, but it enlightened my path, and I again went out in search of berries."                                                                              
[11] "I was still cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with which I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground."
